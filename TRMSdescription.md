## SPECIAL THANKS

A special shout out goes to all the giants that everyone's works are bassed on, and yes even some gratitued to the evil institutions and families that are being exposed with their systems of financial manipulations and the reveiling of their weaknesses.  A super special thanks goes out to Dan Larimer and Shatoshi for pushing the bounds of current blockchain technology and for creating shining examples of the diversity of ideas that can be implemented on the blockchain.

## FORWARD

The history of money is very clear, and the design of a monetary system has not been done in some 400-600 years when the Rothschild dynasty created the Fractional Reserve system and instituted it on their own behalf for their own benefit. Several schools of economics have popped up throughout time, Keynesian, Austrian, etc., but none of them address the fundamental issues that the design of the Fractional Reserve system creates, and certainly none of them suggest a more egalitarian approach to wealth creation. The TRMS is an attempt to address the issues stated above by creating a new, Non Fractional Reserve System, that promotes production and prosperity for all those willing to put out effort to create recyclable resources for the economy and the posterity of all. The issues of Inflation and Deflation are structurally removed, and the elimination of “lack of financing” is addressed. At all steps of the creation of this idea, the main consideration was always “what yields the maximum benefit for all and our posterity”.

# Chapter 1

# Pre-Intro Revision:

## INTRODUCTION:

It is obvious that the world fiat monetary system is collapsing and a new paradigm is necessary to maintain the flow of products to the people. The need of accounting for resources is real and the facilitation of sustainable resources, production and non-coerced employment are necessary. Money should set people free, not bind them from action.

## THE HISTORY OF MONEY (Barter):

In the beginning Barter was the means of exchange for commodities. This is the most basic form of “money” and is what the creation of money should try to match if it wants to eliminate inflation and deflation. Barter makes it clear, that for any “permanent” creation, there can be the creation of a “note” that is exchangeable for it. Since we wish to have a universal monetary system, were the money is exchangeable for anything, it is clear a “note” must be created for the value of the reusable (recyclable) content of a product and that note must be generic. Logic dictates that the “creator” of the product is entitled to the “note” for the product (not a Bank) which they might use to buy other goods others have created and vice verse with their product's recyclable value as collateral to the note(s). --- any other type of system will have an imbalanced between the creation of money (loans now-a-days) and the creation of true wealth (useable resources) thereby resulting in inflation or deflation.

## THE PURPOSE:

A Monetary System should not hinder the ability for labor to produce, and it should have an automatic system that keeps the Money Supply in check with the current Products (physical things possessed) in existence. This insures the free exercise of creative production and minimizes any chance of inflation or deflation of the Money Supply. All “sound” money is backed by something tangible, and “fiat” currency is by nature subject to corruption. For these reasons this Transitional Resource Monetary System (TRMS) is being proposed to the people of the ~~Republic for the united States of America and to the~~ World for its adoption and use. ~~by the our TREASURY for the said union of Free States~~ in order to SECURE THE CREATOR'S BLESSINGS FOR OURSELVES AND OUR POSTERITY.

## MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE:

Three (3) types of NOTES will be issued as $MRTokens on an ongoing basis.
1. Two (2) of them are “LOANS” (at 0%) by the TRMS:
   1. to employees (non-corporate, under Full Liability) called a Temporary Note (TN) backed by the added value to products from their labor.
   1. and to Natural Resource Extractors (Resource Notes:RN) backed by discovered but yet un-recovered natural resources.
   1. Neither of these two (2) types of notes will be issued in the paper form~~seen below~~, they will ONLY be issued as ~~DEBIT  CARDS~~ $MRTokens (electronic funds).
1. The third type is an Asset Note (AN) that in essence never leaves the Money Supply because it represents the value of Recyclable Resources in the finished products in existence and stored in Recycle Centers. These AN's permanently exist as ~~Paper Money~~ $MRTokens in the economy backed by real material wealth.

# MONEY ~~(NOTE)~~($MRT) CREATION : RECAPTURE : DESTRUCTION

## TEMPORARY NOTES

When a worker puts in his personal labor into processes using physical resources, he has Added Labor Value to the products produced that are now in possession within the economy, Because of this “increase” in economic value, it is necessary to create an equivalent amount of money for a temporary term (since the product will eventually wear out) to match that increase. This is done by the TRMSystem creating ~~TN's (TEMPORARY NOTES)~~$MRT at a rate of 50% (see VARIABLES section) of employee/worker wages and paying them directly to the employee/worker (the other 50% of employee wages is paid by the employing business). This reduces the Capital Requirements of a business owner to employ workers, and allows the business to sell the products of production before having to repay the 50% of employee pay ~~(that the Treasury Loaned)~~ at fiscal year end or quarterly as the business deems appropriate.

## NATURAL RESOURCE NOTES

Availability to un-recovered natural resources should not be hindered by the lack of capital to extract said resources. When reasonably shown to exist and be extractable at a minimum 30% profit (to allow for market price variation), the TREASURY will loan RN's to resource extraction businesses to cover expenses in order to accomplish the task. An Environmental Remediation Plan must be accounted for as to “NEGATE” the damages to the environment and its habitat integrity. As the New Resources are sold, the RN's are to be paid back quarterly to the TREASURY. Total Payback of any RN loan must be made within 2 years of receipt of the Notes (see VARIABLES section). [Backed by Un-Recovered Natural Resources]

## ASSET NOTES

The need to keep Notes in the Money Supply to represent the permanent existence of the resources in products which are recyclable is apparent. For that reason, and to assist with businesses needing less capital requirements to start creative projects, the TRMSystem will PAY businesses the raw material value of the Recyclable Resource Content of their finished product (as available to the consumer) in ~~AN's~~$MRTokens. These do not have to be repaid and stay in the Money Supply. ~~Business that produce products that have a percentage of Non-Recyclable Resources (%NR) will be TAXED (and spendable by the Government, according to the People, for the General Welfare) the value of the %NR.~~

[Backed by Recyclable Resources in Products]

# MONEY SUPPLY FORMULA:

 

 

 

 

## VARIABLES

Most the terms of repayment, the percentages of $MRTokens ~~(TN's)~~ towards employee pay, etc. are all subject to fine tuning as well as adjustments by industry category as deemed “beneficial” by the People. It is believed that as wealth in the surrounding man made material environment increases, and therefor the money in peoples pockets increases, and the cost of production keeps going down from automation, at some point people will have so much “cash” and so many inexpensive things to spend it on, that the ushering in of a “New Era” of a “Non-Monetary” system may become possible, and the FREEDOM that it liberates will be able to “benefit the Public Welfare”.

## REAL PROPERTY: Structures & Land

The facilitation of the appropriate use of land to facilitate the General Welfare of All people and All Inhabitants of the Earth is essential and shows stewardship towards creation. Farm Land & Natural Lands have an inherent value, and whatever part of those assess are allowed into the marketplace, and equivalent amount of NOTES must be created. Other types of Land (and small parts of Farm Land) are intended for Structures which hold a decreasing value over time, but also represent an increase in Marketplace Assets and therefore justifies a temporary creation of NOTES. People should be free to create new types of uses for Land, therefore flexibility should be maintained to adapt the Monetary System to those situations as they arise. Control mechanisms will be suggested as examples of ways to maximize benefit for the “General Welfare” of everyone and everything on Earth. Consumable goods, food & drink, do not add a sustained increase in the Material Value in the Marketplace, therefor no NOTES will be created and issued for such things.

 

 

## FARMLAND (Agriculture)

Food is of obvious importance and interim Pres. Turner has suggested that long term (99 year) low interest loans be made available for acquisition and use of Land for food production. TRMS suggests that a Certified Farming Business (CFB) need not purchase Land for use in agriculture, however that CFB may purchase the Land at Fair Market Value (FMV) and own it. When Farm Land is purchased by an Individual/Business from its previous owner, the Treasury will create RN's at up to 90% (+or-) of the FMV or to a lesser extent if the Individual/Business wish to come up with more of their own money. The Treasury will Ledger the Account and the Individual/Business may buy of the ownership rights from the Treasury at any time and at rate they wish. Upon pay off of any portion of the RN's on Loan, the RN's are to be removed from circulation (not a government income source). The Owner of the Land will be given AN's by the Treasury for the Recyclable Resources in the Permanent Structures built for the Farm (the %Non-Recyclable Resources [%NR] must be burdened upon the Business/Farm). Upon sale of the Land with the Structure(s) any remaining RN's and all AN's must be repaid (a 0% interest loan) to the Treasury. Upon construction of any Structure(s), the %NR value is TAXED at 100% (+or-) in AN's and is spendable by the Government for Projects and Payroll. The earnings from the sale of the Recyclable Resources is retained by the Business/Individual. Employees will receive TN”s from the Treasury at 50% of pay and the TN's will be repaid by the Business/Farm at/by their financial year-end.

 

 

## Natural Forest / Food Forest

Forest are self sustaining ecosystems that the Earth has created and depends on for the maintenance of life. The critical nature of these systems requires that our stewardship over these areas is mandatory. For this reason, any project or business that can increase the biodiversity and biomass of an area is declared of benefit to the General Welfare. To whatever extent a business can show an increase in maintained Biomass on the Land, Private or Public, and to whatever extent a Individual/Business can show an increase in diversity of Life on the land, Private or Public, the Treasury will create and issue AN's to the business. If the Land is private and the Business wishes to sell the Forest Land to the Government, the Treasury will create and issue RN's to the business (at the amount of FMV – AN,s already issued = Issued RN's for purchase). The Government may Protect, Hold or Sell this property, as the people deem in the interest of the General Welfare of All on Earth, at any time or place. The Treasury may use the proceeds of sale, less the repayment of any RN's issued at time of purchase, to pay for Government Projects and Payroll.

## COMMERCIAL

Commercial/Service destinations being desirable, the Treasury will create RN's at up to 90%(+or-) of the FMV, or to a lesser extent if the Individual/Business wishes to come up with more of their own money, for the value of Land that a Business/Individual purchases for such an enterprise. In addition the Owner of the Land will be given AN's by the Treasury for the Recyclable Resources in the Permanent Structures built on the Land (the %Non-Recyclable Resources [%NR] must be burdened upon the business). Upon sale of the Land with the Structure(s) the RN's and AN's must be repaid (a 0% interest loan) to the Treasury. Upon construction of any Structure(s), the %NR value is TAXED at 100% (+or-) in AN's and is spendable by the Government for Projects and Payroll, and the earnings from the sale of the Recyclable Resources is retained by the Business/Individual.

 

 

## INDUSTRIAL

Facilities for production are the main arenas for the creation of new wealth and should be encouraged. For this reason, the Treasury will create RN's at up to 90% (+or-) of the FMV, or to a lesser extent if the Individual/Business wishes to come up with more of their own money, for the purchase of Land. In addition the Owner of the Land will be given AN's by the Treasury for the Recyclable Resources in the Permanent Structures built on the Land (the %Non-Recyclable Resources [%NR] must be burdened upon the business). Upon sale of the Land with the Structure(s) the RN's and AN's must be repaid (a 0% interest loan) to the Treasury. Upon construction of any Structure(s), the %NR value is TAXED at 100% (+or-) in AN's and is spendable by the Government for Projects and Payroll, and the earnings from the sale of the Recyclable Resources is retained by the Business/Individual. In addition, the purchase of Production Equipment may be a TN Loan from the Treasury at 0%, spread over the expected useful life of the Production Equipment.

 

 

## HOUSING

Shelter is a fundamental necessity and therefor a necessary component of any claim to the “General Welfare”. For this reason, the Treasury will create RN's at up to 100% (+or-) of the FMV, or to a lesser extent if the Individual wishes to come up with more of their own money, for the purchase of Land. In addition the Treasury will create and give the Homeowner AN's equal to the the value of the Recyclable Resources in the Home/Structure. Also, the Treasury will Loan the Homeowner at 0% over 15 years the the remaining costs. Upon sale of the Land with the Home/Structure(s) the RN's and AN's must be repaid (a 0% interest loan) to the Treasury. Upon construction of any Structure(s), the %NR value is TAXED at 100% (+or-) in AN's and is spendable by the Government for Projects and Payroll, and the earnings from the sale of the Recyclable Resources is retained by the Individual.

 

 

## COMBINED USE

People should be and are free to pursue any creative ideas they have, including but not limited to the creation of new types of Land Use categories, and the creative combination of Use Categories to facilitate the Pursuit of Happiness and the General Welfare. It is the responsibility of the Treasury to adapt the Monetary System to the needs of theses ideas as to best promote the General Welfare.

# Chapter 4

## PUBLIC UTILITIES

Since their inception, Public Utilities have been subject to special regulation in order to maximize the benefit to the General Welfare and to minimize the potential for financial abuse. In addition it is clear that policy should stimulate and promote the more sustainable and least environmentally impacting technologies. None of the commodities below add any permanently recyclable resources so there is NO justification for creation of capital (except for those in the physical buildings etc.) as a main funding source.

 

## ENERGY

Energy does work, and therefor is equivalent to the “Added Value” of human labor. So a sustained increase in available energy is like increasing the output per worker. In the US electric usage is about 11.4 kW per person and a normal human diet is about 2,000 K cal per day. This means that each person in the US uses the energy of some 13 people every day to accomplish their tasks. The average GNP per person is $25,860 per year, and since the mid 1970 per-capita electrical usage has remained stable around 350 million BTU. Despite this, National electricity usage has gone up about 1% per year over a similar 25 year period (75-99). As a “general principal” then, it may be establish that TN's up to the value of 30% of the future end-user available energy expected production of a proposed “Energy Plant” may be loaned to develop the project and paid back over the lifetime of the plant at a minimum of 50% of revenues (until repaid in full).

 

## Electricity

GEOTHERMAL – Of all the traditional “alternative” energies, geothermal by far offers the most potential for long term high output with minimal environmental effect. In addition it utilizes the existing centralized transmission structures and systems of management. The promotion of conversion from Oil and Coal power plants to geothermal is desirable. For this reason a TN loan up to 70% the future end-user available energy expected production for a facility. Payback must therefor also be increased to a minimum of 75% of revenues (until repaid in full).

## WATER POWER –

## OVER-UNITY DEVICES –

## NON-RENEWABLE –

 

 

## Natural Gas

the damages to the environment and its integrity. As the natural gas is sold, the RN's are to be paid back quarterly to the TREASURY. (to allow for market price variation), the TREASURY will loan RN's to natural gas extraction businesses to cover expenses (less 50% of total employee pay – see above) in order to accomplish the task. An Environmental Remediation Plan must be accounted for as to Natural Gas is not only used for energy, it is used for fertilizer production. Being a non-renewable resource, it makes sense to minimize its burning and non recoverable fertilizer use, and maximize its uses where at least some of, if not all of, its value may be recycled (same holds true for Oil). When reasonably shown to exist and be extractable

## COMUNICATIONS

The ability to communicate is essential in a modern society as well lubricating commerce and is essential for maintenance of a responsive government to the people. For this reason, the “general welfare” dictates that these services should be made available to all at a minimum of encumbrance. At this time the author reserves any opinions as to government financing, however he does feel this is an appropriate area for “Government Projects”, however this must be decided by the voters/constituents. Communication is not a tangible physical object that is added to the marketplace, so there con not be the creation of notes. However, the physical structures and infrastructure are entitled to AN's to the extent they are recyclable.

 

## Phone -

## Internet –

## Future Technology –

 

## WATER

Availability of fresh water is historically the measure of wealth in a civilization. There is NO doubt that water is of up most importance to people, along with water and breathable air. For this reason, water projects have historically been government projects. Voter approval required for all projects. However, water is a “temporary” commodity like food, and is used shortly after produced in usable availability. Therefor the creation of notes is not possible. Government Projects would be able to use created AN's to the extent that the physical materials of the project were recyclable (as with all business). Voters would suggest adaptions to Government Projects and their funding.

 

## Capture of Rain –

## Use of Streams & Rivers –

## Well and Ground Water –

## Lakes and Dams

 

 

## NEW CREATIONS

It should not be assumed that all good ideas on Utilities and their possibilities has been considered. Therefore the possibility of new creations should encouraged and given consideration when brought up.

 

## PRIVATE INDEPENDENCE

Private independence is paramount. If people wish to stay off the grid or off the sewage system, or use alternative construction or alternative energies, they should be not only allowed but encouraged to do so. All benefits possible should be given to those seeking independence.
