EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

PREFACE
This summary is intended to be the simplest and shortest possible explanation of this system while accurately conveying the main concepts behind the Economic System know as the TRMS, and its logical implementation within the blockchain ecosystems. Such implementation could create a seamless and complete automated global economic system that promotes lower barriers of entry for goods producers and the creation of products with the highest level of recyclable and re-usable materials as possible.  The expected long term results of operating an economic system like this is that over time there will be more and more resources and goods in the economy while at the same time increasing the in-pocket money that the average person has as savings (available cash) all while the currency value stays linked to commodity quantities.  At some point people will have so many things and so many “dollars” that the perceived wealth will be so high that there will no longer be any need to sell anything for profit and we will be able to enter the era of the Resource Based Economy (RBE).

MODERN MONEY CREATION
Although there have been a few examples of GOLD backed currencies in the modern era (the USA until 1933,1971 and Switzerland until 2000) after the Renaissance European royalty was compelled to  expand the money supply beyond their stored gold and coin which brought about the first “Fractional Reserve” institution of money creation.  The Rothschilds figured this one out, if the economy grows there needs to be an equivalent growth in the money supply or else the economy grinds to a halt.  In fact neither INFLATION nor DEFLATION are desireable, one causes the devaluation of savings, the onther devalues assets (decreasing the desire to own them-think droping of MEMORY prices as a comparison). The optimal monitary system would hold the value of money stable, so that pepoles savings held value and business could invest with confidence about the future. Looking back at what happened one would have to concluded the royalty were not to bright and got duped by the Rothschilds and the “Banksters” as they were allowed the ability to create money by the mere request of a borrower and his signature and run away with the intrest scott free.

Along comes the Colonies and they realized this same concept and created Colonial Script, but this time, instead of the Bankster’s getting to issue it at interest, the Government would spend the new money into the economy for public projects (like roads etc.) at no interest and based on the annual growth rate of the economy.  As long as the government was accurate and not abusive of this ability to create money, then this system worked far superior to the Bankster Fractional Reserve system.

Enter blockchain, STEEMIT and Dan’s gift of putting a twist on the familiar and pushing the boundaries of possibility to new levels.  Steemit follows this same concept, saying evidence shows economies grow and therefor a token economy can have some rate of Token Inflation which can responsibly be spent (eg. government) to the block producers and to promote desired behaviors (content creation: Steemit).  This was a genius move that is a milestone in the history of cryptocurrencies and blockchain and glimmers at the future of yet unknown possibilities of these crypto ecosystems.

During the creation of the TRMS a re-evaluation of these money creation schemes was conducted and a question was posed:  What is the “Most Fair” method of money creation?

The past showed the Banksters said “I care not who makes the Laws……".
And the Colony Governments said “The Government will Create and Decide”
And the USA said Gold and Silver

But really,,,,, if the legitimacy for creating more monetary supply is that there is more goods and resources in the economy, then shouldn’t the people that “add wealth” to the economy be the beneficiaries of the “new money created”?  How this would function will be be examined below. 

These links are an educational series on the original non-crypto TRMS. They include issues that do not need to be addressed in a “cryptoTRMS” as the cryptoTRMS is a global system and has no concerns about import and export of materials:

THE PROBLEM WITH CRYPTOCURRENCIES (MONEY COINS)
We live in a controlled economic system of Fractional Reserve money creation utilizing notes and bonds of personal and National debt (IOU’s) to create bank deposits and circulating Federal Reserve Notes.  The beneficiary of this activity is primarily the Federal Reserve and the Bank of International Settlements.  

We all recognize that this system is a form of slavery using a Keynesian economic model and is in serious need of change.  Along comes Bitcoin and people feel in their hearts that the change is near, but yet we fall into our old habits and instead of rethinking the situation, we do the same old things, uncreative "DigitalGold" or just a plain currency.

“We can’t defeat the existing system; we must build a better one instead” - David McElroy
"Build a New Model That Makes the Existing Model Obsolete" - Buckminster Fuller

So what do we do, we start using Cryptos like we already use money in the existing fiat monetary system.  We speculate and hope for gains and don’t institute new paradigms of lending and behavioral motivation towards common goals instead of self interest.  We have this wonderful seemingly full of limitless possibilities new tool and we go and use it like a hammer, like the least intelligent tool in the box.

What we need is a whole new economic system where the creation of money goes to the creator of the real wealth (retain-able recyclable content and added value) and not to the bank or some central entity like government.  A brand new way of monetary creation that is used to encouraged social benefit and prosperity via stimulating ease of entry into both business and markets for entrepreneurs and intelligent design of products to maximize recycle-ability and reuse-ability.  An intelligently designed Economic System that includes all aspects of the economy from Natural Resource extraction and Commodities Exchanges to Design and Recycling, with OpenMarketPlaces to exchange goods freely and arbitration and governance systems for continued smooth operation.

TRMS – Transitional Resource Monetary System

DESIRED SOCIAL RESULTS
It is the intention of this economic system to provide a stable currency backed by recyclable materials both in storage and in products within the economy. 
to promote the usage of recyclable materials and technologies as well as modularity and reusable products.
to lessen the burden of labor costs on producers.
to lessen the costs for natural resource extractors.
To lessen the costs for building a home.
to create such abundance that the perceived cost of things becomes insignificant.
Elimination of Corporations and Admiralty Law on the Land

THE 2 BRANCHES OF DAE (Decentralized Autonomous Economy)
The DAE of the TRMS is composed of a governance token (TRMS) of its governing DAO and a circulating Monetary Resource Token ($MRT) whose circulation equals the sum of 3 sub components:
	1. Recyclable Resources (in products or storage)
	2. Natural Resources (not yet extracted)
	3. Labor adding value to physical products

DISTRIBUTION METHODS
	TRMS Token (“Terms Vote”)
The governance token will be widely airdropped to EOS accounts and TRMS Dapp developers as their observed concern for similar ideals makes them perfect candidates.  EOS snapshot account holders with accounts of 100 EOS tokens or more that are NOT Exchanges will get TRMS tokens in a 1:1 manner, such that the amount given will equal 70% of the Distribution.  The remaining 30% shall be divided in two parts, 20% will be given to developers of Dapps (aka the platform) and their support networks and finally 10% shall stay with the original designer (M. Traver) until he feels confident in ongoing performance of the DAE and sells off his influence (TRMS Tokens).  Governance tokens will have voting rights on issues of VARIABLES in the Dapps’ systems (DAE). 

	MRT Token (“$mart Coin”)
The currency of the DAE for the TRMS is the $MRT (eg. $100MRT = “100 Smarts”) and is used for all purposes of commerce in this physical economy. The value is fixed to a ratio of recyclable commodity values including gold and silver. The monetary supply is set by the 3 forms of currency creation explained below. Some require the BURNING of the token when repaid at the end of the contract.

1.  Anyone in possession of goods with recyclable content (who will recycle it at the end of its life-cycle) may go to a qualified “Recycle Center” and have an RFID tracker (VEN style [initial partnership?]) installed and a certification of the recyclable content value less the cost of recycling of the good given and paid out in new $MRT coin in said value .

2.  Labor cost in the amount of 50% will be provided to physical product producers and will be due and repayable when the product is sold or 1 year, whichever is quicker.  This will reduce the labor cost burden for business owners with new ideas and increase the money supply to approach the value added to the goods by that labor.

3.  Natural Resource Extractors upon submission of proper documentation of Resource Value, Cost of Extraction, Cost of Reclamation and Labor Costs can get ½ the net value of the resource, after said considerations, for up to one year or when the resource is sold, whichever comes first.

MONETARY MOTIVATORS
Any product design with certified recyclable content may get that amount of recyclable content for production (less recycling costs) FREE of charge at the Recycle Center or location external to the DAE. This encourages product producers to make products with the highest percentage of recyclable materials possible and that they are as easily recyclable as possible, as this will reduce Production Costs significantly.  Modular and Reusable products will get relative fair consideration.

The TRMS DAE will lower the entry barriers for new entrepreneurs by lowering startup cost both in the smart use of materials and in spread out labor costs.  Lower Barriers means more employed people and a stronger economy with more competition and innovation. In exchange for this service all producers agree to make available all their products on the TRMS MarketPlace where the currency is $MRT.  In this way all employees and others accepting the $MRT have a guaranteed place to spend them.
