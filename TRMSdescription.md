# TRANSITIONAL RESOURCE MONETARY SYSTEM (TRMS)

##### Based on The TRANSITIONAL RESOURCE MONETARY SYSTEM (TRMS) By Mark Traver (c2009)

## SPECIAL THANKS

A special shout out goes to all the giants that everyones works are bassed on, and yes even some gratitued to the evil institutions and families that run them for exposing their systems of financial manipulations and reveiling their weaknesses.  A super special thanks goes out to Dan Larimer and Shatoshi for pushing the bounds of current blockchain technology and shining examples of the diversity of ideas that can be implemented on the blockchain.

## FORWARD

The history of money is very clear, and the design of a monetary system has not been done in some 400-600 years when the Rothschild dynasty created the Fractional Reserve system and instituted it on their own behalf for their own benefit. Several schools of economics have popped up throughout time, Keynesian, Austrian, etc., but none of them address the fundamental issues that the design of the Fractional Reserve system creates, and certainly none of them suggest a more egalitarian approach to wealth creation. The TRMS is an attempt to address the issues stated above by creating a new, Non Fractional Reserve System, that promotes production and prosperity for all those willing to put out effort to create recyclable resources for the economy and the posterity of all. The issues of Inflation and Deflation are structurally removed, and the elimination of “lack of financing” is addressed. At all steps of the creation of this idea, the main consideration was always “what yields the maximum benefit for all and our posterity”.

# Pre-Intro Revision:

## INTRODUCTION:

It is obvious that the world fiat monetary system is collapsing and a new paradigm is necessary to maintain the flow of products to the people. The need of accounting for resources is real and the facilitation of sustainable resources, production and non-coerced employment are necessary. Money should set people free, not bind them from action.

## THE HISTORY OF MONEY (Barter):

In the beginning Barter was the means of exchange for commodities. This is the most basic form of “money” and is what the creation of money should try to match if it wants to eliminate inflation and deflation. Barter makes it clear, that for any “permanent” creation, there can be the creation of a “note” that is exchangeable for it. Since we wish to have a universal monetary system, were the money is exchangeable for anything, it is clear a “note” must be created for the value of the reusable (recyclable) content of a product and that note must be generic. Logic dictates that the “creator” of the product is entitled to the “note” for the product (not a Bank) which they might use to buy other goods others have created and vice verse with their product's recyclable value as collateral to the note(s). --- any other type of system will have an imbalanced between the creation of money (loans now-a-days) and the creation of true wealth (useable resources) thereby resulting in inflation or deflation.

## THE PURPOSE:

A Monetary System should not hinder the ability for labor to produce, and it should have an automatic system that keeps the Money Supply in check with the current Products (physical things possessed) in existence. This insures the free exercise of creative production and minimizes any chance of inflation or deflation of the Money Supply. All “sound” money is backed by something tangible, and “fiat” currency is by nature subject to corruption. For these reasons this Transitional Resource Monetary System (TRMS) is being proposed to the people of the ~~Republic for the united States of America and to the~~ World for its adoption and use. ~~by the our TREASURY for the said union of Free States~~ in order to SECURE THE CREATOR'S BLESSINGS FOR OURSELVES AND OUR POSTERITY.

## MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE:

1. Three (3) types of NOTES will be issued as $MRTokens on an ongoing basis.
1. Two (2) of them are “LOANS” (at 0%) by the TRMS:
   1. to employers (non-corporate, under Full Liability) called a Temporary Note (TN) backed by Gold & Silver
   1. and a Natural Resource Note (RN) backed by un-recovered natural resources.
1. Neither of these two (2) types of notes will be issued in the paper form seen below, they will ONLY be issued as ~~DEBIT  CARDS~~ $MRTokens (electronic funds) as they are to be recaptured (BURNED) each year (or appropriate cycle).
1. The third type is an Asset Note (AN) that in essence never leaves the Money Supply because it represents the value of Recyclable Resources in the finished products in existence. These AN's permanently exist as ~~Paper Money~~ $MRTokens in the economy.

# MONEY (NOTE) CREATION : RECAPTURE : DESTRUCTION

 

## TEMPORARY NOTES

When a worker puts in his personal labor into processes using physical resources, he has Added Labor Value to the products produced that are now in possession within the economy, Because of this “increase” in economic value, it is necessary to create an equivalent amount of money for a temporary term (since the product will eventually wear out) to match that increase. This is done by the TREASURY creating TN's (TEMPORARY NOTES) at a rate of 50% (see VARIABLES section) of employee/worker wages and paying them directly to the employee/worker (the other 50% of employee wages is paid by the employing business). This reduces the Capital Requirements of a business owner to employ workers, and allows the business to sell the products of production before having to repay the 50% of employee pay (that the Treasury Loaned) at fiscal year end or quarterly as the business deems appropriate. [

## NATURAL RESOURCE NOTES

Availability to un-recovered natural resources should not be hindered by the lack of capital to extract said resources. When reasonably shown to exist and be extractable at a minimum 30% profit (to allow for market price variation), the TREASURY will loan RN's to resource extraction businesses to cover expenses in order to accomplish the task. An Environmental Remediation Plan must be accounted for as to “NEGATE” the damages to the environment and its integrity. As the New Resources are sold, the RN's are to be paid back quarterly to the TREASURY. Total Payback of any RN loan must be made within 2 years of receipt of the Notes (see VARIABLES section). [Backed by Un-Recovered Natural Resources]

## ASSET NOTES

The need to keep Notes in the Money Supply to represent the permanent existence of the resources in products which are recyclable is apparent. For that reason, and to assist with businesses needing less capital requirements to start creative projects, the TREASURY will PAY businesses the raw material value of the Recyclable Resource Content of their finished product (as available to the consumer) in AN's. These do not have to be repaid and stay in the Money Supply. Business that produce products that have a percentage of Non-Recyclable Resources (%NR) will be TAXED (and spendable by the Government, according to the People, for the General Welfare) the value of the %NR.

# MONEY SUPPLY FORMULA:

 

 

 

 

## VARIABLES

Most the terms of repayment, the %'s of Treasury Loan (TN's) towards employee pay, etc. are all subject to fine tuning as well as adjustments by industry category as deemed “beneficial” by the People. It is believed that as wealth in the surrounding man made material environment increases, and therefor the money in peoples pockets increases, and the cost of production keeps going down from automation, at some point people will have so much “cash” and so many inexpensive things to spend it on, that the ushering in of a “New Era” of a “Non-Monetary” system may become possible, and the FREEDOM that it liberates will be able to “benefit the Public Welfare”.
